## Features

- ðŸŽ® Immersive 3D environment with realistic lighting and shadows
- ðŸŽ¯ Smooth player movement and animations
- ðŸŽ­ Detailed 3D models for characters and environment
- ðŸŒŸ Dynamic lighting and atmospheric effects
- ðŸŽµ Immersive sound effects and audio feedback
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful visual effects and post-processing
- ðŸŽ² Multiple AI players with realistic behavior
- ðŸŽª Detailed environment with guard towers, walls, and decorative elements

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or later
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-red-light-green-light.git
cd 3d-red-light-green-light
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Download 3D models:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/download-models.sh
./scripts/download-models.sh
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev

```

## How to Play

1. Use the `W` or `â†‘` key to move forward
2. Use the `S` or `â†“` key to move backward
3. When the doll is facing away (green light), you can move
4. When the doll turns around (red light), you must stop moving
5. If you move during red light, you're eliminated
6. Reach the finish line to win!
